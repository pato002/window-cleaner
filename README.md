# window-cleaner
This is a script to turn off some Windows 11 features, minimize telemetry, and set a few security settings.

To use this script, clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file, carefully read and comment changes in the debloater.bat script and in the LGPO.txt file that you don't want to be made, and then run the script. Afterwards, I suggest running RUN ME AFTER APPLYING SETTINGS AND REBOOTING.bat to fix possible system file corruption after making changes to Windows.

Currently made for Windows 11 Pro. It is very vaguely tested and needs a rewrite for easier reading of changes it makes to the system.
