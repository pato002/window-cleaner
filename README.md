# window-cleaner
This is a script to turn off some Windows 11 features, minimize telemetry, and set a few security settings.

To use this script, clone this repository or download a ZIP file, carefully read and comment changes in the debloater.bat script and in the LGPO.txt file that you don't want to be made, and then run the script. Afterwards, I suggest running RUN ME AFTER APPLYING SETTINGS AND REBOOTING.bat to fix possible file corruption after making changes to Windows.
